# Recap

![LoadBalancer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c4xp/Devops04/master/assets/loadbalancer.png)

we've worked with the basic building blocks of stateless apps on Kubernetes: Deployments, ReplicaSets, Pods, Services. There are alternatives to Deployments (not all apps support rolling updates): StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, etc. ConfigMaps and Secrets are useful to store application configuration. Also, weâ€™ve only used Deployments in the most basic manner. In production, you should set CPU and memory requests and limits, and you may be interested in autoscaling, among other things.

# Rancher Orchestrator

Rancher is a Kubernetes management tool to deploy and run clusters anywhere and on any provider.

Rancher can provision Kubernetes from a hosted provider, provision compute nodes and then install Kubernetes onto them, or import existing Kubernetes clusters running anywhere.
